# Igbo Language Model - Final Year Project

This repository contains the code and resources for a language model developed as part of a final year project focused on the Igbo language. The goal is to build and evaluate a machine learning model capable of understanding and processing Igbo text.

## Project Structure

- `data/` ‚Äî Dataset files used for training and evaluation
- `notebooks/` ‚Äî Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training
- `models/` ‚Äî Saved trained models and checkpoints
- `src/` ‚Äî Source code for data processing, model training, and evaluation
- `README.md` ‚Äî Project documentation

## Project Objectives

- Collect and preprocess Igbo language data
- Train a language model tailored to Igbo text
- Evaluate the model on relevant natural language processing tasks
- Provide scripts and tools for using the trained model

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Recommended: virtual environment for package management

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yuyi5la/igbo_model-finalyearproject-.git
   cd igbo_model-finalyearproject-


2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run notebooks or scripts:**

   Use the Jupyter notebooks in `notebooks/` to explore data and train the model.

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
